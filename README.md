# SDET Test Engineering Portfolio

This repository demonstrates how I design and implement scalable,
maintainable, and CI-friendly test automation systems using
Java, Python, and JavaScript.

The focus is not tool usage, but test strategy, reliability,
and failure diagnostics.

## What this portfolio proves
- Framework design in Java (Selenium)
- Modern UI automation using Playwright (JavaScript)
- API testing via Postman and Playwright
- Flaky test detection and root-cause analysis
- CI-friendly execution strategy

## What I chose NOT to automate
- Purely visual UI checks (low ROI)
- Third-party authentication providers
- Static content pages covered by lower test layers
