## API Testing with Playwright

This module demonstrates API testing using Playwright’s request context,
designed for tight integration with UI tests and CI pipelines.

### What this covers
- Auth token handling
- API-based test data setup and teardown
- Schema and response validation
- API → UI test handoff

### Why Playwright for APIs
Using the same tool for API and UI testing reduces duplication,
simplifies CI execution, and enables more reliable end-to-end scenarios.
