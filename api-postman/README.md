## API Testing with Postman

This module demonstrates API testing using Postman collections and environments,
designed for fast feedback and regression confidence.

### What this covers
- Environment-based configuration
- Chained requests (create → update → delete)
- Pre-request and test scripts
- Newman CLI execution for CI compatibility

### Why Postman here
Postman is used for exploratory API validation, contract-level checks,
and quick regression coverage before UI tests run.
