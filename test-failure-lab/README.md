## Test Failure Lab

This module intentionally contains failing and flaky tests
to demonstrate how test instability is diagnosed and resolved.

### Scenarios included
- Timing-related flakiness
- Poor vs improved logging
- Retry masking vs root-cause fixes
- Async behavior issues

### Purpose
The goal is not perfect tests, but clear failure signals.
This reflects real-world SDET work more accurately than “green-only” demos.
