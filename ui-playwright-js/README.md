## Playwright UI Automation (JavaScript)

This module demonstrates modern, fast UI automation using Playwright with JavaScript.

### What this covers
- Reliable selectors using data-testid
- Parallel test execution
- Network interception to reduce UI dependency
- Screenshot and trace capture on failure

### Design principles
- Prefer API setup over UI setup where possible
- Avoid retries masking real issues
- Optimize for CI speed and determinism

This framework represents how I would test a modern frontend application
where speed, stability, and signal quality matter.
